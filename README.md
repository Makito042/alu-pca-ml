# Advanced Linear Algebra (PCA) – Formative Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains our group’s submission for the Machine Learning formative assignment on **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. The project demonstrates a full PCA implementation from scratch using only **NumPy**, including eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis and a custom matrix multiplication library.

## Contents

- `notebook/` – Google Colab notebook with PCA code and outputs  
- `african_crises.csv` – Africanized dataset used for PCA  
- `handwritten_calculations.pdf` – Manual eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations (handwritten)  
- `alumathPeer Group 10/` – Python package for matrix multiplication  
- `README.md` – This file  

---

## Instructions

### Running the PCA Notebook

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.  
2. Make sure `african_crises.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.  
3. Run each cell sequentially.

### What the Notebook Covers

- Loading and standardizing data using **NumPy only** (no `sklearn` or `pandas` standardization)  
- Covariance matrix calculation  
- Eigendecomposition (computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors)  
- Sorting and selection of principal components  
- Projecting data onto the principal components  
- Visualization of dimensionality reduction

## Notes

- The handwritten eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations are provided in `handwritten_calculations.pdf` as proof of manual work and understanding.  
- Each group member contributed to the calculations and signed the document as collaboration evidence.

## Custom Matrix Multiplication Library

We developed a simple Python package for matrix multiplication named **alumathPeer Group 10**.

### Installation

```bash
pip install matrixfun
```
